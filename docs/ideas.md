##Innovative Idea: Meetup style web application that lets people post sports events or activities online. Can give a place and time, also allows for live events and informal or pickup events. For example, people are trying to play basketball and looking for more people, they can post online and others can join.
More focused on sports than meetup, not for formal events, live updates and shows a map where it is taking place.
##Important Components: Event posting, Live updating, Map?
