## Team Name: Upsilon

## Innovative Idea: 
A platform for umass students to share music, projects, art, etc. that they may be working on for other Umass students to see and talk about. It will also allow people to set up events, for example a band could set up a small concert and other students could RSVP, or someone could set up an art gallery. Different forms of media would be broken up into separate forums for people to share and discuss their work.

## Important Components:
- Authentication
-- Only UMass students would be able to see & post content, and RSVP to & create events  
- Password Hashing
-- User database will be stored with a username and a hashed version of the password
- Data Storage
-- Posts, User profiles, and Events will be stored locally on the server
- Server-Side
-- Express.js server router
