##Team Name: Upsilon

##Application Name: UMass Creators

##Team Overview: Casey Ryan: https://github.com/caseyryan22465 James Yang: https://github.com/JDY26 Julia Lin: https://github.com/hyuelin

##Innovative Idea: A platform for umass students to share music, projects, art, etc. that they may be working on for other Umass students to see and talk about. It will also allow people to set up events, for example a band could set up a small concert and other students could RSVP, or someone could set up an art gallery. Different forms of media would be broken up into separate forums for people to share and discuss their work. ##Important Components:

Authentication
Only UMass students would be able to see & post content, and RSVP to & create events
Password Hashing
User database will be stored with a username and a hashed version of the password
Data Storage
Posts, User profiles, and Events will be stored locally on the server
Server-Side
Express.js server router
